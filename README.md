# Object-Oriented Programming in Python

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook demonstrating **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts in Python.
It‚Äôs designed for learners and developers who want to understand how classes, objects, inheritance, and encapsulation work in practical code examples.

## üìò File Overview

**File:** `oop_update.ipynbperrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr.ipynb`
**Language:** Python (Jupyter Notebook)

The notebook covers various OOP concepts such as:

* Class and Object creation
* Constructors (`__init__`)
* Instance and Class variables
* Method definitions
* Inheritance and method overriding
* Encapsulation and abstraction examples
* Real-world use cases of OOP in Python

---

## üß† Learning Objectives

By going through this notebook, you will learn how to:

* Define and initialize classes in Python
* Create and use objects effectively
* Apply inheritance to reuse code
* Understand encapsulation and data hiding
* Implement simple polymorphism
